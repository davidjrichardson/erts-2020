### Trickle firmware

The trickle firmware here was built from the [Contiki NG](https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/blob/6cedb103d44bde26852ce98a254b52cac2f11442/examples/libs/trickle-library/trickle-library.c) version of the Trickle library provided by Contiki. Contiki NG is a refactored version of the original code and operates the same as the original. A precompiled firmware binary for the Sky mote platform is also provided here.

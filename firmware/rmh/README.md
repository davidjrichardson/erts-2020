### Rime Multihop firmware

The Rime Multihop firmware here was built from the [Contiki](https://github.com/contiki-os/contiki/blob/45265249fc2d3c8cdf8494414ad946a30876d943/examples/rime/example-multihop.c) code sample for the Rime networking stack. A precompiled firmware binary for the Sky mote platform is also provided here.
